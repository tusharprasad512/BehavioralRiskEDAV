    "text": "1.1 Rationale for Choosing this Topic\nThe impetus behind selecting this particular topic is rooted in the growing global concern surrounding non-communicable diseases, with obesity being a key contributor. Lifestyle factors, such as dietary choices and levels of physical activity, play pivotal roles in the development and perpetuation of obesity. As researchers committed to improving public health, understanding the intricate connections between nutrition, physical activity, and obesity becomes paramount. By focusing on the BRFSS dataset, we aim to unravel patterns, trends, and correlations that can offer nuanced insights into the behavioral aspects influencing weight status. This endeavor is not merely an academic pursuit but a proactive response to a pressing public health challenge. The data from BRFSS, integrated into DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database, holds the promise of informing evidence-based strategies for obesity prevention and intervention."

The dataset employed in our project encapsulates a wealth of information crucial for understanding the behavioral nuances that underlie obesity trends. The integration of this data into the DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database enhances its utility, providing a comprehensive resource for researchers, policymakers, and public health practitioners. As we embark on this investigative journey, our aim is to contribute not only to the academic discourse surrounding nutrition, physical activity, and obesity but also to offer actionable insights that can shape public health initiatives aimed at fostering healthier lifestyles and mitigating the obesity epidemic."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWe have taken the data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This dataset includes data on adult’s diet, physical activity, and weight status from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This data is used for DNPAO’s Data, Trends, and Maps database, which provides national and state specific data on obesity, nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding. The data collected by the BRFSS is actually a survey data, which is collected across different socio-economic cohorts.\nThe metadata was last updated on August 26, 2023.\nThis dataset is intended for public access.\nWe downloaded the CSV file from the link given below.\nhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system\nPublisher of the data : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Maintainer of the data : DNPAO Public Inquiries\nThe data can be provided in multiple formats, e.g CSV, JSON file, XML file.\nThe number of rows in the dataset = 88629 The number of rows in the dataset = 33\nThe data can actually be divided into different questions and its supporting variables.\ne.g “Question: Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity?” will have a numerical value which is actually a percentage. It will be shown that this answer belongs to which Class of question, location of the respondents as well as a category. This category column makes this data very interesting in the sense of how it is saved. For most of the question - topic - location combination, there exists multiple categories like RACE, Education, Income, etc as well as the values of the categories apart from the answer to the question. Due to this, a lot of columns like Education, Gender, Income has values which are missing when the Stratification category don’t correspond to that particular category value. It is actually better if we drop these particular columns when doing the analysis since they don’t really add a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the initial missing value analysis, we can see that a lot of columns like Data_Value_Unit, Total, Gender, etc have a high number of NULL values. Lets try to analyze all the columns and try to drop/transform them from the data.\n\n2.1.1 Data Cleaning/ Transformation\nLets look at each and every column in the data frame and see how relevant they are. We will try to transform/drop them if we see it to be relevant to be dropped. Please refer to the appendix to see the description of every column of the dataset.\n\nWe will be dropping some columns like Datasource, Data_Value_Unit, Data_Value_Type, Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol since they have only one unique values, hence adding nothing to the analysis.\nWe will be dropping columns like YearEnd, Data_Value_Alt, Topic since there are other columns which have the same values as these.\nWe can drop since Data_Value_Footnote since it is purely correlated to the fact whether the Data_Value field is NA or not. In the case where it is NA, it has the value “Data not available because sample size is insufficient.”. Hence, we should keep in mind that wherever Data_Value field is NA, it is due to the lack of sample size.\nThen there are some columns which we can drop that have a high number of NULL values as mentioned in the graph. This is due to the fact that there exist other proxy columns like StratificationCategory1 and Stratification1 in their place. These columns are Total,Age.years,Education,Gender,Income, Race.Ethnicity and LocationDesc.\nWe are going to drop Low_Confidence_Limit and High_Confidence_Limit, since we are not going to use their fields in our analysis.\nFinally we are going to drop all the ID columns whose values we already have like ClassID, TopicID, QuestionID, DataValueTypeID, LocationID, StratificationCategoryId and StratificationID1\n\nIn the end, we are left with 9 columns which are YearStart, LocationAbbr, Class, Question, Data_Value, Sample_Size, GeoLocation, StratificationCategory1 and Stratification1."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nInorder to carry out the research mentioned in introduction, we will be using the new dataset which is much more cleaner. That dataset has these particular columns.\nYearStart: YearStart represents the start for collecting information on adult diet, physical activity, and weight status.\nLocationAbbr: Identifies the Abbreviations of specific geographic locations.\nClass:\n\nDescription: Categorizes the data into classes related to health and lifestyle\nValues: “Physical Activity,” “Obesity / Weight Status,” “Fruits and Vegetables.”\nContext: Classifies the data based on health-related categories, providing insights into physical activity, obesity, and nutrition related to fruits and vegetables.\n\nQuestion: The ‘Question’ column encompasses a diverse array of health-related inquiries and measurements for adults, providing a comprehensive overview of various aspects such as physical activity, weight status, and dietary habits.\nData_Value: Data_Value represents diverse data points. The values range from 0.9 to 77.6 and include missing values (NA). This column signify quantitative measurements as a percentage that answers the questions given to the cohort.\nSample_Size: The sample size indicates the number of observations for each corresponding data entry.\nStratificationCategory1: The “StratificationCategory1” column categorizes data based on various demographic factors, including “Race/Ethnicity,” “Education,” “Income,” “Age (years),” “Gender,” and “Total.” The “NA” values indicate missing or undefined entries in this categorization.\nStratification1: This column provides a detailed breakdown of the data based on various demographic factors, allowing for nuanced analysis and comparisons across different population segments.\nWith the presence of these columns, we will have all the relevant data required to carry the research plan.\nTo give an example, if we wanted to find the obesity patterns prevalent along adults, we would find the relevant question ‘Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity’ and perform analysis for this cohort across different socio-economic filters like Income, Race or across Demographic filters like Age and location. After getting the relevant insights, we plan to showcase our findings using various different and relevant visualizations."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nNow that we have our clean data, lets perform Missing value analysis on this particular data.\nNow that we have chosen the important columns, we are going to rename to columns.\n\nLocationAbbr -&gt; Location\nData_Value -&gt; Value\nSample_Size -&gt; SampleSize\nStratificationCategory1 -&gt; Category\nStratification1 -&gt; CategoryVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this particular graph, we notice that Value, SampleSize and GeoLocation has some missing values. Lets try to dive deeper into this and find if we can identify some correlations and patterns to fix.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the missing value plots we can find a lot of insights.\n\nFrom the graph it seems like only Value, SampleSize and GeoLocation have missing values.\nOut of all the rows, around 88% seems to have columns with no missing data. Rest of the rows seem to have at least one column with missing values.\nAccording to the missing patterns, there are 4 different patterns available. The first pattern is where we have all the rows completely filled. The second pattern has Value and SampleSize missing. The third pattern has only the GeoLocation missing. The fourth pattern has Value, SampleSize, Category and CategoryValue missing.\nThere is a correlation between the missing SampleSize rows and Value rows. There are also a correlation between the missing Category and CategoryValues.\nFrom the initial data cleaning, we know that this is due to the fact that there rows have an insufficient sample size. Due to this insufficiency, both the Value and SampleSize field are NULLs together. After a quick check, we can decipher that this indeed is true.\nRegarding pattern 4, it is not sure why these particular columns (i.e Category and CategoryValue) are NULL for some certain rows but since they are NULL only when Pattern 2 exists, i.e lack of sufficient sample size, we can choose to combine it with pattern 2 for all intents and purposes.\nThe interesting case here is the pattern 3 since this missing data is not due to the lack of sufficient sample size. After a quick analysis, we can see that this corresponds to the Location value as ‘US’. This makes a lot of sense since, US itself doesn’t have a GeoLocation value but it’s internal states do have a GeoLocation value. Hence we need to keep this in mind which doing analysis for the entire Country as a whole rather than State wise analysis.\n\nConclusions:-\n\nWe can drop rows belonging to pattern 2 and pattern 4 since due to the lack of sufficient SampleSize, we don’t have values to actually derive insights from.\nWe cannot drop rows belonging to pattern 3 since they correspond to the entire US Data as a whole."
