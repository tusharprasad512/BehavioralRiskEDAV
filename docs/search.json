    "text": "1.1 Rationale for Choosing this Topic\nThe impetus behind selecting this particular topic is rooted in the growing global concern surrounding non-communicable diseases, with obesity being a key contributor. Lifestyle factors, such as dietary choices and levels of physical activity, play pivotal roles in the development and perpetuation of obesity. As researchers committed to improving public health, understanding the intricate connections between nutrition, physical activity, and obesity becomes paramount. By focusing on the BRFSS dataset, we aim to unravel patterns, trends, and correlations that can offer nuanced insights into the behavioral aspects influencing weight status. This endeavor is not merely an academic pursuit but a proactive response to a pressing public health challenge. The data from BRFSS, integrated into DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database, holds the promise of informing evidence-based strategies for obesity prevention and intervention."

    "section": "2.1 Technical Description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nWe have taken the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This dataset includes data on adults’ diet, physical activity, and weight status from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This data is used for DNPAO’s Data, Trends, and Maps database, which provides national and state-specific data on obesity, nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding. The data collected by the BRFSS is actually survey data, which is collected across different socio-economic cohorts.\nThe metadata was last updated on August 26, 2023. This dataset is intended for public access. We downloaded the CSV file from the link given below:\nhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system\nThe data is also provided in multiple formats, e.g., CSV, JSON, and XML files. The dataset’s number of rows and columns is 88629 and 33, respectively.\n\nPublisher of the data: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nMaintainer of the data: DNPAO Public Inquiries\n\nThe data can actually be divided into different questions and their supporting variables.\ne.g., “Question: Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity?” will have a numerical value, which is actually a percentage. It will be shown that this answer belongs to which Class of question, the location of the respondents, as well as the category. This category column makes this data very interesting in the sense of how it is saved. For most of the question - topic - location combination, there exists multiple categories like RACE, Education, Income, etc as well as the values of the categories apart from the answer to the question. Due to this, a lot of columns like Education, Gender, and Income have values that are missing when the Stratification category does not correspond to that particular category value. We should drop these particular columns when analyzing since they do not add much.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the initial missing value analysis, we can see that a lot of columns, like Data_Value_Unit, Total, Gender, etc, have a high number of NULL values. Let us analyze all the columns and drop/transform them from the data.\n\n2.1.1 Data Cleaning/ Transformation\nLet us look at each and every column in the data frame and see how relevant they are. We will transform/drop them if we see them as relevant to be dropped. Please refer to the appendix to see the description of every column of the dataset.\n\nWe will be dropping some columns like Datasource, Data_Value_Unit, Data_Value_Type, and Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol since they have only one unique value, hence adding nothing to the analysis.\nWe will be dropping columns like YearEnd, Data_Value_Alt, and Topic since other columns have the same values as these.\nWe can drop Data_Value_Footnote since it is purely correlated to the fact whether the Data_Value field is NA or not. In the case where it is NA, it has the value “Data not available because sample size is insufficient.”. Hence, we should keep in mind that wherever the Data_Value field is NA, it is due to the lack of sample size.\nThen, there are some columns that we can drop that have a high number of NULL values, as mentioned in the graph. This is because other proxy columns exist in their place, like StratificationCategory1 and Stratification1. These columns are Total, Age.years, Education, Gender, Income, Race.Ethnicity and LocationDesc.\nWe will drop Low_Confidence_Limit and High_Confidence_Limit since we will not use their fields in our analysis.\nFinally, we are going to drop all the ID columns whose values we already have, like ClassID, TopicID, QuestionID, DataValueTypeID, LocationID, StratificationCategoryId, and StratificationID1\n\nIn the end, we are left with 9 columns, which are YearStart, LocationAbbr, Class, Question, Data_Value, Sample_Size, GeoLocation, StratificationCategory1, and Stratification1."

    "section": "2.2 Research Plan",
    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nIn order to carry out the research mentioned in the introduction, we will be using the new dataset, which is much cleaner. That dataset has these particular columns.\nYearStart: YearStart represents the start for collecting information on adult diet, physical activity, and weight status.\nLocationAbbr: Identifies the Abbreviations of specific geographic locations.\nClass:\n\nDescription: Categorizes the data into classes related to health and lifestyle\nValues: “Physical Activity,” “Obesity / Weight Status,” “Fruits and Vegetables.”\nContext: Classifies the data based on health-related categories, providing insights into physical activity, obesity, and nutrition related to fruits and vegetables.\n\nQuestion: The ‘Question’ column encompasses a diverse array of health-related inquiries and measurements for adults, providing a comprehensive overview of various aspects such as physical activity, weight status, and dietary habits.\nData_Value: Data_Value represents diverse data points. The values range from 0.9 to 77.6 and include missing values (NA). This column signifies quantitative measurements as a percentage that answers the questions given to the cohort.\nSample_Size: The sample size indicates the number of observations for each corresponding data entry.\nStratificationCategory1: The “StratificationCategory1” column categorizes data based on various demographic factors, including “Race/Ethnicity,” “Education,” “Income,” “Age (years),” “Gender,” and “Total.” The “NA” values indicate missing or undefined entries in this categorization.\nStratification1: This column provides a detailed breakdown of the data based on various demographic factors, allowing for nuanced analysis and comparisons across different population segments.\nWith the presence of these columns, we will have all the relevant data required to carry out the research plan.\nTo give an example, if we wanted to find the obesity patterns prevalent among adults, we would find the relevant question ‘Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity’ and perform analysis for this cohort across different socio-economic filters like Income, Race or across Demographic filters like Age and location. After getting the relevant insights, we plan to showcase our findings using different and relevant visualizations.\nIn order the answer what role environmental, cultural, demographic, and social factors play in shaping behaviors related to obesity, nutrition, and physical activity, we can create Bar graphs for the total obesity, physical, and nutrition rate across these categories. For the environmental factors, we can create US Map plots and show our results there.\nIf we want to find the correlation between the nutrition and physical activity rates with the obesity rate, we can find the total rates across various social and demographic factors, and build scatterplots to find these correlations.\nInorder to find the change in weight status across years, we can use Time Series plots across various factors to see the trends across obesity."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nNow that we have our clean data let us perform a Missing value analysis on this particular data.\nNow that we have chosen the essential columns, we are going to rename those columns.\n\nLocationAbbr -&gt; Location\nData_Value -&gt; Value\nSample_Size -&gt; SampleSize\nStratificationCategory1 -&gt; Category\nStratification1 -&gt; CategoryVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis particular graph shows that Value, SampleSize, and GeoLocation have some missing values. Let us try to dive deeper into this and find if we can identify some correlations and patterns to fix.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can find a lot of insights from the missing value plots.\n\nFrom the graph, only Value, SampleSize, and GeoLocation seem to have missing values.\nOut of all the rows, around 88% seem to have columns with no missing data. The rest of the rows seem to have at least one column with missing values.\nAccording to the missing patterns, four different patterns are available. The first pattern is where we have all the rows completely filled. The second pattern has Value and SampleSize missing. The third pattern has only the GeoLocation missing. The fourth pattern has Value, SampleSize, Category, and CategoryValue missing.\nThere is a correlation between the missing SampleSize rows and Value rows. There is also a correlation between the missing Category and CategoryValues.\nFrom the initial data cleaning, we know that this is due to the fact that the rows have an insufficient sample size. Due to this insufficiency, both the Value and SampleSize fields are NULLs together. After a quick check, we can decipher that this indeed is true.\nRegarding pattern 4, it is not sure why these particular columns (i.e., Category and CategoryValue) are NULL for some specific rows. However, since they are NULL only when Pattern 2 exists, i.e., lack of sufficient sample size, we can choose to combine it with Pattern 2 for all intents and purposes.\nThe interesting case here is the pattern 3 since this missing data is not due to the lack of sufficient sample size. After a quick analysis, we can see that this corresponds to the Location value as ‘US’. This makes a lot of sense since the US does not have a GeoLocation value, but its internal states do have a GeoLocation value. Hence, we need to keep this in mind when doing analysis for the entire Country as a whole rather than State-wise analysis.\n\nConclusions:-\n\nWe can drop rows belonging to pattern two and pattern four since we do not have values to derive insights from due to the lack of sufficient SampleSize.\nWe cannot drop rows belonging to pattern three since they correspond to the entire US Data as a whole."

    "text": "From the Questions of Interest list, We will try to ans the below questions:\nQ4. How do demographic (Age) and social factors (Education, Income) influence Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity patterns?\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome: The bar graph shows that the people earning the most have the lowest percentage of obesity. On the other hand, the people who make the least amount of money have the highest percentage of obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation: The bar graph shows that the most educated people have a minimum percentage of obesity rate. However, people with the lowest education qualification have a maximum percentage of obesity rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAge: The age group 18 to 24 has the lowest obesity percentage. Then there is an increasing trend from the 18 to 24 age group to the age group of 45- 54. Then, after this age range, the percentage of obesity starts decreasing.\nConclusion: Influence of demographic (Age) and social factors (Education, Income) towards Obesity: From the above 3 bar plots we can see that people with highest amount of income, highest educational qualification and the younest group of people (18 to 24) are least obese.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome: The most minor percentage of adults consuming fruit less than one time daily are the people who earn the most. On the other hand, the highest percentage of people consuming fruit less than one time daily are the ones who make less than $15,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation: The bar graph shows that the most educated people, having the lowest percentage, reported consuming fruit less than once daily. However, people who were high school graduates had the highest percentage who reported consuming fruit less than once daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nAge: The oldest group, having the lowest percentage, reported consuming fruit less than once daily. Meanwhile, people between 18 and 24 have the highest percentage of reported consuming fruit less than one time daily.\nConclusion: Influence of demographic (Age) and social factors (Education, Income) towards Nutrition (Fruit): From the above 3 bar plots we can see that people with highest amount of income, highest educational qualification and age between 65 or hgiher consumes most fruits.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome: From the bar plot, an increasing percentage is visible from the most earned group of people to the least-earned group of people.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation: Likewise, in the “Income Category,” an increasing percentage is visible from the most educated people to the least educated people\n\n\n\n\n\nAge: a decreasing percentage is visible from the oldest people to the youngest people who engage in no leisure-time physical activity\nConclusion: Influence of demographic (Age) and social factors (Education, Income) towards Physical Activity (Not Active): From the above 3 bar plots we can see that people with highest amount of income, highest educational qualification and age between 18 and 24 most plysically active.\ncombined Conclusion: Each of the graph individually making a lot of sense. But if we again want to make a combined conclusion, we are see beautiful overlap among Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity patterns. We can see people who earn the most and have highest level of educational qualification are least obese and have comsumen the maximum amount fo fruit, which makes sense.\n\n\n//Q3. What role do environmental (Location) and cultural (Race/Ethnicity) factors play in shaping behaviors related to nutrition (Fruit) and physical activity (Not active)?\nTo analyse this question we are going to consider question: Percent of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily by Race Factor.\n\n\n\n\n\nRace: People of 2 or more races have the highest percentage of reported consuming fruit less than once daily, while Hispanic individuals have the lowest.\n\n\n\n\n\nRace: Hispanics have the highest percentage of reported consuming fruit less than once daily, while Asian individuals have the lowest.\nConclusion: By Race/Ethnicity we can say that Hispacic people are consuming most amount of fruit, at the same they come under the least physicaly active group.\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily [45.9 to 48.7] are mostly from OK (Oklahoma), AR (Arkansas), LA (Louisiana), MS (Mississippi), AL (Alabama), TN(Tennessee), WV (West Virginia).\nPercent of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily is the least (33.2 to 36.2] from the below states: OR (Oregon), IL (Illinois), VT (Vermont), MT (Montana), MA (Massachusetts), ID (Idaho), DC (District of Columbia), ME (Maine).\nThe black-marked zone is for the people from certain areas who didn’t respond to this question.\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity [45.9 to 48.7] are mostly from OK, AR, LA, MS, TN, AL, Wv\nPercent of adults who report most active (33.2 to 36.2] from the below states: VT (vermont), DC (district of columbia), CA (california), RI (rhode island), NH (new hampshire), ME (maine), WA (washington), NJ (new jersey), CT (connecticut).\nThe black-marked zone is for the people from certain areas who didn’t respond to this question.\nCombined Conclusion: A overlap is visible from both of the maps, and that is people having least amount of food amd least phisically active are from OK, AR, LA. On the other hand peopl who have maximum amount of food and most acitve are from VT, DC, ME.\nSo, from thr above analysis we can clearly measure the role of environmental (Location) and cultural (Race/Ethnicity) factors play in shaping behaviors related to nutrition (Fruit) and physical activity (Not active)\nQ1. What dietary patterns (Fruit and Veg) are prevalent among adults, and how do these patterns correlate with obesity rates?\nTo analyze this research interest, we have taken the question, ‘Percentage of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity’; with this, we will combine different food habits (both Fruit and vegetables) by age and location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace: There is a positive relationship visible by Race. It means the people who are taking least amount of fruit are obese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome: There is a positive relationship visible by Income. It means the people who are taking least amount of fruit are obese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation: There is a positive relationship visible by education. It means the people who are taking least amount of fruit are obese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge: There is a weak positive relationship visible by the scatterplot when we are using “Percent of adults who report consuming fruit less than once daily by age” and “Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity by age”. This implies that when there is an increase in the percentage of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily by age, then there will also be an increase.\nSo, this is making a lot of sense. Because by anu means, people who take least amount of fruit, should be more obese.\nCase 02: - ve Question1 = ‘Percent of adults who report consuming vegetables less than one time daily’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace: There is a positive relationship visible by Race. It means the people who are taking least amount of vegetables are obese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome: There is a positive relationship visible by Income. It means the people who are taking least amount of vegetables are obese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation: There is a positive relationship visible by Education. It means the people who are taking least amount of vegetables are obese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge: There is a negative relationship visible by Age. It means the people who are taking least amount of food are not obese.\nQuestion2 = ‘Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity’ QuestionCategoryScatterplot(df,Question1,Question2,‘Age’)\nThe scatterplot shows a weak negative relationship when we are using “‘Percent of adults who report consuming vegetables less than once daily’” and “Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity by age”. This implies that when there is an increase in the percentage of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily by age, then there will also be a decrease. Conclusion: Neither positive nor negative co-relation is strong. The age group 18 to 24 is the outlier for both cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear positive relation between Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity and the percentage of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily by region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, no relationship is visible between the percentage of adults aged 18 years and older who are obese and the percentage of adults who report consuming vegetables less than once daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ2. Are there discernible patterns in weight status changes over time, and what factors contribute to shifts in obesity rates?\nPercent of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily [45.9 to 48.7] are mostly from OK (Oklahoma), AR (Arkansas), LA (Louisiana), MS (Mississippi), AL (Alabama), TN(Tennessee), WV(West Virginia).\nPercent of adults who report consuming fruit less than one time daily is the least (33.2 to 36.2] from the below states: OR (Oregon), IL (Illinois), VT (Vermont), MT (Montana), MA (Massachusetts), ID (Idaho), DC (District of Columbia), ME (Maine).\nThe black-marked zone is for the people from certain areas who didn’t respond to this question.\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent of adults who report consuming vegetables less than once time daily [45.9 to 48.7] are mostly from ND (North Dakota), IA (Lowa), NV(Nevada), CA (California), TX (Texas), LA (Louisiana), MS (Mississippi)\nPercent of adults who report consuming vegetables less than one time daily is the least (33.2 to 36.2] from the below states: ME (Maine) The black-marked zone is for the people from certain areas who didn’t respond to this question.\nConclusion: There is a geographical contrast among different states regarding having more/ less vegetables/fruits.\nQ2. Are there discernible patterns in weight status changes over time, and what factors contribute to shifts in obesity rates?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace/Ethnicity: Likewise, in all the categories like Income, Education, and Age, an increasing trend is visible over the years by Race. Among the different kinds of Race, Non-Hispanic Black exhibit the highest percentage of obesity, whereas Asian carries the lowest percentage of obesity. (We got the same information from Barplot as well.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy income: Moreover, there has been a significant growth in the percentage of obesity from 2011 to 2021. The group of people who are earning the least (less than $15,000) carry the maximum percentage of obesity, and the group of people who make the most ($75,000 or greater) hold the minimum percentage of obesity. (We got the same information from Barplot as well.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Education: Like the Income Category, a clear increasing trend is visible over the years among different levels of educated people. The least educated group (those less than high school) has the highest percentage of obesity over the year. On the other hand, the most educated group (college graduates) has the lowest percentage of obesity over the year. (Exactly same information we got from barplot as well)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge (year): A clear increasing trend is visible over the year among all groups of people by Age. People whose Age is between the mid-40s and mid-50s show the highest percentage of obesity. On the other hand, the youngest group of people (18 to 24) shows the lowest percentage of obesity. (We got the same information from Barplot as well.)\nConclusion: Overall, there has been an increase in the obesity rate over the years. If we consider the education and income factors, then least earned and least-educated people exhibit the highest percentage of obesity. On the other hand, most and most educated people show the least amount of obesity. Now. Among the youngest adults, the obesity rate is very high. So, we can establish that young people are neither the richest nor the most educated (supporting evidence from our early analysis).\n[So this analysis supports the bar plot analysis]"

Hence, people who are more health conscious seem to have more fruits every day."
