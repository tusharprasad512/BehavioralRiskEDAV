# Behavioral Risk Factor Analysis

## For those unfamiliar with the BRFSS and its significance, it is a national surveillance system that systematically collects and analyzes health-related data across the United States. The dataset employed in our project encapsulates a wealth of information crucial for understanding the behavioral nuances that underlie obesity trends. The integration of this data into the DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database enhances its utility, providing a comprehensive resource for researchers, policymakers, and public health practitioners. As we embark on this investigative journey, our aim is to contribute not only to the academic discourse surrounding nutrition, physical activity, and obesity but also to offer actionable insights that can shape public health initiatives aimed at fostering healthier lifestyles and mitigating the obesity epidemic.
